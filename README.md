## Howdy ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤ 

I'm a design technologist who loves the back of the frontend, but really wishes there was a better way to phrase it. I got my start on the web building terrible proto-emo poetry websites on Tripod and Angelfire, and now I build (hopefully) less terrible websites professionally.

I've never been much for blogging, but I fancy myself a public speaker. I enjoy sharing what I've learned and that is my most natural outlet. If you'd ever like me to give a talk, reach out!
